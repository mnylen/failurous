# Failurous

Failurous is an open source webapp for monitoring exceptions in your
live applications.

## Installation

The Failurous server is pretty much just a cookie-cutter Rails 3 application, which uses MongoDB as the backend. As prerequisites you'll need:

* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
* Ruby 1.8 or newer

When you have these two installed, and MongoDB is up and running, just clone this repository and run `bundle install` to install the required gems. Then hit `rails server -e production` to start the app. By default the server will start in port 3000.


## Clients
